# Contribution

Cowork is an open-source project, and is currently in the development stage. We are open to contributions to the project in the form of features, infrastructure or documentation.

- To contribute to this project, please follow a ["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) workflow. Please do not try to push directly to this repo unless you are maintainer.

- Our [issues](https://github.com/Vivekagent47/cowork-forntend/issues) page is kept up to date with bugs, improvements, and feature requests.

- **Describing your issue:** Try to provide as many details as possible. What exactly goes wrong? How is it failing? Is there an error? "XY doesn't work" usually isn't that helpful for tracking down problems. Always remember to include the code you ran and if possible, extract only the relevant parts and don't just dump your entire script. This will make it easier for us to reproduce the error.

- **Sharing long blocks of code or logs:** If you need to include long code, logs or tracebacks, you can wrap them in `<details>` and `</details>`. This [collapses the content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) so it only becomes visible on click, making the issue easier to read and follow.
